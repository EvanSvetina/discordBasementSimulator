<h1>The Idea:</h1><br>
<b1>
The premise is simple. The player walks into a strange, rancid basement populated by computers, Dorito crumbs, and a strange fellow known throughout the lands as IShowGreen.
IShowGreen is feverishly at work, without any breaking in his concentration as he mines crypto and rapidly types on his keyboard. The player can explore his many open devices, including a computer where they can play a BitCoin mining minigame and an open discord server where the player can talk to random people online (simulated ofc).<br>
<h2>Possible ASSETS:</h2><br>
<ul>
  <li>Basement BG (can be iterated on, D&D Placeholder for now</li>
  <li>Animated IShowGreen (50% done, just not animated)</li>
  <li>Computer sprites (probably just duplicate one and slightly modify it)</li>
  <li>Music (sneaky snitch or custom beats)</li>
  <li>Sound FX (computer games, IShowGreen talking)</li>
  <li>potential easter eggs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Progression:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To complete the level, players must obtain at least 1 bitcoin and talk to IShowGreen at least 20 times.</li>
  <li>The </li>
  <li>After talking to IShowGreen 20 times, basement door opens and the player can exit the basement (touching the light sends an alert of completion or smthn idk)</li>
</ul>
